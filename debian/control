Description: A portable Objective-C bridge for Common Lisp
 Objective-CL lets a Lisp programmer make use of Objective-C frameworks
 by providing a bridge that neatly integrates Objective-C classes and
 methods with the Common Lisp Object System.
 .
 The bridge works on both the GNU and NeXT (that is, Apple) runtimes and
 is therefore suitable for GNUstep and Cocoa programmers alike.  It is
 not tied to any particular Lisp compiler, either.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent Lisp code.
